It's a  Text Classification for Lighting Product Detection project involves training a machine learning model to classify Lighting Product givein a link and  development of a Flask-based application capable of analyzing text data extracted from a provided link (e.g., datasheet, product description) to determine whether the content corresponds to a lighting product or not. I've successfully trained a randomforestclassifier (rf_classifier_bg.pkl) using bag of words vectorizer and achieved around 90 percent F1 score.
